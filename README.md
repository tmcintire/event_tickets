<h1>Event Ticket System</h1>

<p>I am working on a ticketing/admission system for events.  I am a board member of our local swing dance society.  We usually keep track of our admission/expenses to our events on paper and those papers get filed away.  Only one person has access to those documents at a time, so I thought I would spin up some Django-ness and write an application that would help us do that. </p>
<p>If you like my idea, give me a star!</p>
